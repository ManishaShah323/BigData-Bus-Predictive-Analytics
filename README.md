# BigData-Bus-Predictive-Analytics

## Project Overview
This project develops a predictive analytics platform for analysing UK public bus transport data using Big Data techniques. The system integrates timetable, real-time vehicle location, and disruption datasets obtained from the UK Bus Open Data Service (BODS) to forecast service delays and identify peak travel hours.

The project is developed as part of the **Big Data Programming Project (ST5011CEM)** module at Softwarica College of IT & E-Commerce, in collaboration with Coventry University.

## Objectives
- To collect and integrate large-scale public transport datasets
- To preprocess and clean transport data for analysis
- To build predictive models for bus delay forecasting
- To identify peak travel hours using classification techniques
- To evaluate model performance and reflect on technical and ethical considerations

## Datasets Used
- **Timetable Data (GTFS)** – scheduled bus arrival and departure times  
- **Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) Data** – real-time bus movement data  
- **Disruption Data** – incidents affecting bus services  

Data Source: UK Bus Open Data Service (BODS)

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- SQLite
- Scikit-learn
- GitHub
- Streamlit for dashboard visualisation

## Ethical and Legal Considerations
This project uses open-access public datasets and does not involve personal or sensitive data. All data usage complies with GDPR and open data licensing guidelines.
